# spring-splunk

Problem statement:
We have different applications feeding into each other. Debugging an issue requires logging into each individual application to look at the logs. With small number of apps/boxes it's not an issue, but it quickly becomes tedious as the number of applications Â increase!

Solution:
It would be awesome to have all of your logs aggregated into one place so you can see the process flow and perform queries against the logs from all applications from one place.
Splunk is used for monitoring and searching through big data

Tech Stack:
Spring boot, Elastic search, Log Stash, Kibana, Splunk
